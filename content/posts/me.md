I am Julien, french engineer in AI since 2017.

I have worked in several organizations on different topics, all related to AI or where AI is applied to.


ðŸ”¥ I am currently looking for a new opportunity in big AI companies where I could apply my skills to pre-train, finetune models.


I love playing golf (even though I am not very good at itâ€¦), going to the gym, reading, learning new things and working (not a joke, I do love it).

I sometimes write articles about tech, most of them are AI related:

- [/posts/kolmogorov-ai-framework/](https://bornlex.github.io/posts/kolmogorov-ai-framework/)
- [/posts/physics-informed-neural-networks/](https://bornlex.github.io/posts/physics-informed-neural-networks/)
- [/posts/lora/](https://bornlex.github.io/posts/lora/)
- [/posts/mlx-dqn/](https://bornlex.github.io/posts/mlx-dqn/)

But not all of them:

- [/posts/2018-10-14-code-injection/](https://bornlex.github.io/posts/2018-10-14-code-injection/)
- [/posts/ternary-computing/](https://bornlex.github.io/posts/ternary-computing/)

Since I am 26 years old, I teach at EPITA a course named Deep Learning for Time Series:

- First course about time series: [Time series](/posts/epita-1-timeseries/)
- Second course about recurrent neural networks: [RNN](/posts/epita-2-rnn/)
- Third course about time series generation using Transformers: [Transformers](/posts/epita-3-transformers/)
- Fourth course about physics informed neural networks: [Physics informed neural networks](/posts/epita-4-pinn/)

I also sometimes spend a few hours developing algorithms that I find interesting or POC on hot topics:

- GPT2 : https://github.com/Bornlex/GPT2
- A RAG application to search into the french government contract database (which is not very convenient): https://github.com/Bornlex/Quick-RAG-Example
- A Deep Q Learning algorithm: https://github.com/Bornlex/MLX-DQN
- A whitespace interpreter: https://github.com/Bornlex/Whitespace-interpreter
- And so many more!
